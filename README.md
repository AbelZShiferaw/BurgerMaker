# BurgerMaker

BurgerMaker is an app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app then displays the burger on the left side of the paga.

Each burger in the waiting area also has an "Eat it" button which enables the user to virtually "eat" the burger
